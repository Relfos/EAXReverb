EAXReverb
============

_EAXReverb_ implements a audio environment reverb effect DSP (EAX/EFX) in C++.  
This code was based in the OpenALsoft C implementation of the EAX reverb algorithm.

A sample project is included:
* Takes a input file that contains audio in raw format (16-bit, mono, 44100hz)
* Outputs another raw audio file, this time in stereo, and with added EAX reverb.
